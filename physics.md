## Quantum physics principles
## Superposition
## Entanglement
## Quantum fields
* The true fundamental element of matter, particles are points in a quantum field
* Particle accelerators initiate disturbances in quantum fields
### Particles
* Not absolute, they might appear for one observer in a particular frame of reference based on their speed
