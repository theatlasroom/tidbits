# Physics
## The standard model

## Quantum physics principles
* Wave function: a mathematical description of everything we know about a Quantum system, labelled with psi. Closely linked to the systems probability distribution
* Quantum system: something being studied using QM ie a particular electron moving, or a bunch of particles
## Superposition
## Entanglement
## Quantum fields
* The true fundamental element of matter, particles are points in a quantum field
* Particle accelerators initiate disturbances in quantum fields
### Particles
* Not absolute, they might appear for one observer in a particular frame of reference based on their speed
## String theory
