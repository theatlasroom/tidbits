## Time management
### General
* Manage your time instead of letting it manage you
* Track where you are spending your time, make estimates, measure then compare to your estimate
* Put time into a daily schedule (either end of the day for the next day, or at the start of the day)
	* Remove tasks from your list that you _shouldnt_ be doing (out of scope, not your priority etc)
	* Identify the 3/4 most important tasks and do them first
	* Organize tasks based on importance rather than urgency
	* Use the eisenhower matrix to help prioritize tasks
	* Do - Important deadlines with high urgency, complete right away
	* Decide - Often long term goals and strategy, spend most of your time on these
	* Delegate - Often distractions, they are important but dont contribute to your output
	* Delete - Distractions with little value, ignore these as much as possible

| | Urgent | Not urgent |
|---|---|---|
|Important | Do | Decide |
|Not important | Delegate | Delete |

* Where possible, group similar tasks togethor, reduce context switching
* Avoid multitasking, focus on the task at hand and block out distractions, take one task at a time
* Set time limits on tasks - do not attempt to work on it until its done
* Build in buffers - short mental breaks after completing a task help with focus and motivation
* Learn to say no - its better to complete fewer tasks that bring more value
* Organize your notes / task list, automate repetitive tasks where you can
* Eliminate distractions - routinely identify your top two distractions and work on eliminating them / reducing their impact
* Awareness: thinking realistically about your time by understanding it is a limited resource
* Arrangement: Organizing goals, plans, schedules and tasks to most effectively use your time
* Adaptation: regularly monitor how you use your time, adjust to interruptions and changing priorities

### Beating procrastination
* The main cause is a lack of self-regulation
* Resisting the temptation to do something, through willpower and retraining
* Daily tasks / routine help beat procrastination by building your willpower
* Mindfulness helps to build willpower
* Exercise, eat well and drink water
* Push past your social comfort zone, count 3 heartbeats and act, waiting any longer leads to more opportunity to create excuses
* The more you overthink the more you procrastinate
* Plan micro-habits, daily repeatable tasks that take chunks out of a bigger tasks / job
* Its easier to find the right motivation rather than increasing willpower
	* Extrinsic motivation: usually doesnt work for cognitivte / creative tasks, better for manual tasks
	* Intrinsic motivation: focusing on goals only can lead to unhappiness in the present, reaching the goal gives limited happiness
	* Journey based intrinsic motivation: focus on enjoyable activities that lead to your goals
* Focus on meaning and purpose
* Start when you're NOT ready
