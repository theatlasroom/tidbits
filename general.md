## Transitioning to managing

  * Clarify our new role, understand the tasks you will continue to do from your old role and any gaps you have for your new role
  * Plan the transistion, schedule any training / check-ins
  * Transfer responsibilities and relationships, over-communicate what is happening, document as much as you can

## Leadership

## Psychological safety
* "A shared belief by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking"
	- Being comfortable to admit mistakes
	- Being comfortable to challenge each other for the better
* Traits of psychological danger: 
	- Fear of admitting mistakes 
	- blaming others, 
	- "common knowledge effect", 
	- narrow / non diverse viewpoints explored
* Punishment culture - if we don't allow reasonable failures to happen we stifle iteration and ingrain a culture of "we have always done it this way"
* Blame culture - reduces trust between team members and stifles creativity  
* Not embracing feedback - missed opportunities for improvement, easy for misunderstanding / mixed messages
* Perception vs Intent - be mindful of psychological safety in all actions, how can what you mean be perceived, how do you perceive others intent?
* Higher intent - using your confidence to encourage others to be involved
* Moral courage - being courageous to do what is morally right, even when there is a risk to yourself
* As a leader
	- Different team members provide different strengths, avoid contrasting and comparing team members when evaluating performance
	- Ensure you are a participant of the team identity, there should not be a separate identity for leaders within the team	
	- Give negative feedback 1:1, avoid blaming and shaming
	- Ensure people have an opportunity to reasonably fail

## Systems thinking
* Mapping points of interaction and interconnectivity within a system
* Thinking about the impacts of your interventions on the wider system
* "Where can i best target this change for maximum impact?"
* Power, complexity and interconnectivity
* Triple loop thinking - ??
* Biases: 
  - Attribution 
  - Confirmation
  - Affinity
  - Status quo
  - Self servicing
  - Belief bias
  - Framing
  - Hindsight
  - Anchoring
  - Unconscious
  - Overconfidence
- Triple loop learning: Outcome control, understanding, value and meaning
- Question formulation technique - https://rightquestion.org
- The five whys
- Are you measuring the impacts of your actions and looking at both good and bad outcomes or only looking for reasons you are 'right'?
- Are you listening to prove yourself right?
- Are you asking enough questions, are they open / closed?
