# ML
## General notes
* Software engineering: We tell the computer what to do
* ML: We show the computer examples
* Linear regression: simplest form of ML based on a straight line
	* Using the line of best fit on a graph, we can estimate new values
	* Prediction vs model vs actual value
	* When building a model we try to average the amount of error
	* The model is the straight line
	* Loss is the difference between the predicted output and ground truth (observed)
* Overfitting: training the model on the same data consistently will tune the model for the training data, not the actual solution
* MNIST - dataset of hand drawn numbers used for image recognition
