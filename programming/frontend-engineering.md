## Introduction

## What + Why

### What is frontend engineering

- Frontend usually refers to the presentation layer of some kind of software or hardware device
  - A layer of abstraction to simplify how a user interacts with a complex system
- In the context of web development the client is typically a web browser
- So we can think of it as a discipline within web development that (mostly) deals with what happens on the client side of a web site or application
- The responsibilities of this role are usually to ensure development a user interface that is used to interact with a system, product or service

### Why do we need FE?

- The internet has become an integral part of the lives of many people around the world
- Bridging the gap between users and a product or service, informed
  by design decisions

### Understanding users + understanding the business

- Understanding users
  - User demand, web design has improved dramatically over the years, so users have much higher expectations of how web applications should look, feel and operate
  - It should "just work"
  - Catering for the various conditions in which users use web applications, on their phone on a busy train vs in an office with dual 4K monitors
- Understanding the companys goals and business process, these are often exposed via APIs or databases
  - knowing how to connect these services to the

### Typical types of FE?

- UI focused
- Application / data focused

## Typical role / skills

### Collaboration + communication (The secret sauce)

- Overarching goals
  - Ensures that users are able to complete goals with a product
  - Ensures that the product adheres to the companys vision, brand and design philosophies
- In a typical cross functional team (design + FE + BE)
  - Designers will develop prototypes for a user flow, detailing a process / service / product that has been designed based on the needs of a user
  - BE implement the business logic to execute the tasks (interacting with a databse, sending email notifications, retrieving the latest readings from the Hubble telescope)
  - FE are there to glue these things togethor on the screen, ensuring the end result is consistent, performs well and is robust enough to withstanding changing conditions (internet disconnects, server crashes and stops responding)
- To achieve these goals, FEs require knowledge of:
  - The goals of the user, what should this interface enable a user to achieve?
  - ~~Boundaries of their chosen tools, current architecture (if there is one), or the design system~~
  - Boundaries of the BE services and processes, what are the edge cases? How much data do we get? How often is the data refreshed
  - The existing application architecture (if there is one)
- This requires lots of communication and collaboration with other disciplines to ensure the end result works as expected, or the correct compromises can be made based on any constraints

## Tools and technologies

### Languages, frameworks and runtimes

### Build tools

### Monitoring??

### Challenges

- Performance challenges
- Framework / language churn
- Server side rendering
- Reliability and safety

## Emerging trends

- PWAs
- Compile to JS tools
- Functional JS
- Serverless
