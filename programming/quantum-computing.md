# Quantum computing
## Overview
* Computes using qubits - quantum bits
* Qubits can be modelled in multiple ways, but require a method to produce a quantum property
* Common quantum properties used include electron spin

## Naive understanding
* Computation works by using a superposition of qubits to compute a result
  - This produces a result with a probability
  - The computation needs to be re-run multiple times to verify


## Types

## Languages / Frameworks

## Quantum cryptography
* [ANU Quantum RNGs](https://qrng.anu.edu.au/)
* [Quantum encoded data transmission](https://www.quintessencelabs.com/)

## Problems
* Maintaining quantum states is difficult
* Generating a sufficient amount of quantum bits for useful computation
