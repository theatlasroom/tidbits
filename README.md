# tidbits
I'm re-learning a bunch of things and also just trying to make sure anything new/useful/interesting I learn I have documented and noted down somewhere for easy reference. 

Why? because its so damn annoying when you have to solve the same problem / look for a bit of information and you can't remember where you wrote it down.....maybe that's just me.
