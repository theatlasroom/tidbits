## Overview
* Management philosophy aiming to create an environment for better decision making and execution
* Aim for everyone being empowered to lead in your organization
* Decentralized: empowered individuals make decisions without needing centralized approval
* Applied at an organizationl level, individuals receive greater agency for self leadership, resulting in more informed decisions made quicker
* MECC is for ICs and People managers, everyone is a __Manager of One__
* An ideal environment for MECC needs:
	* Communciation guidelines: robust information for all aspects of communication in the organization, including async, difficult topics and tools
	* Shared set of values: actionable and clearly documented, reinforced by actions and used to filter in hiring
	* Team trust: a baseline of trust across the organization is needed to embrace change
	* Focus on results: measure output instead of input, clear transparent goals allow individuals to take ownership of how their work contributes
	* Culture of belonging: cultivate an inclusive environment, creating a non-judgemental culture that welcomes diverse contributions

## Informed Decisions
* How does the organization ensure any staff can consume information (self-serve) and contribute
* Designed to scale across timezones, functions, levels, personality types and consumption preferences
* Information should be public by default and optimized for maximum contritbution
* Leadership scales beyond individuals and their tenure, information written down transparently allows others to contribute and correct
* Data such as policy, workflows and values should live in a SSOT (single source of truth)
* Individual teams may use different tools / locations, but ensure they are transparent and correctly crosslinked
* Use low context communication, be explicit, direct and use simple language. 
* Aim to be comprehensive not narrow in communications
* Providing as much context as is available in information exchanges leads to more informed decision making
* ICs and manager are responsible for seeking information in order to respond effectively to a scenario
* Situational leadership is displayed when a leader adjust behaviour to adapt to each changing scenario
* Decisions are better informed when they include a maximally diverse array of perspectives
* The best ideas should win, not the loudest
* MECC defaults to written, asynchronous information sharing

## Fast Decisions
* Optimize for speed of knowledge retrieval
* Iteration with a low level of shame is a key aspect of MECC
* Iteration enables faster execution, shorter feedback loops and the ability to course correct sooner
* Teams can be slowed by the fear of overstepping boundaries and doing work outside their immediate remit
* Aim to eliminate silos, focus on collaboration and feel comfortable with others contributing to your domain
* Asynchronous brainstorming, providing a proposal first and space for others to contribute leads to faster decision making
* Everything is in draft by default, leading to less red tape politics
* Assigning DRIs (directly responsible individuals) prevents the risk of sluggish decision making
* Deliberate informal communications help build trust (coffee chats, social calls, special interest channels)
* Getting to know people outside the context of your work builds trust and prevents conflict
* Prioritize two way door decisions (easily reversible), this empowers DRIs to make decisions quicker
* Irreversible decisions are the only time more thorough decision making should be used

## Many Decisions
* Focus on quantity of decisions in a stretch of time and the results from the fast progress
* Conventional approaches strive for consensus and avoiding risk
* Focus on a bias for action
* Organizations should strive to have smaller teams iterating transparently and quickly
* Decisions should be made by the person doing the work 
* Say why not just what - share not only what decision is made, but why
* Explaining why a decision was made builds trust and avoids speculation, it also documents the reasoning for the future
* Focus on transparently articulating your reasoning, not on justifying the decision against every other option
* Traditional approaches tie decision making to meetings, limiting how decions can be made
* Boring solutions help reduce complexity in the organization 
* Resisting unhealthy constraints ("this is how companies mature" mindset) helps organizations to continue operating agile and efficiently while scaling

## Executing Decisions
* Execution is about establishing a baseline for future iterations, not a point in time solution
* No matrix organization means you should only have one manager, this is essential to decision making
* Agency and bias for action come with a need for a tolerance for mistakes and appreciation for two way door decision
* Micromanaging stifles execution, agency empowers individuals to focus their time and attention
* MECC prefers KPIs linked to OKRs
* If you're not creating OKRs to improve KPIs you're either missing the KPIs or you have the wrong OKRs
* MECC reframes execution as a series of iterations
* Prioritize due dates over scope, cut scope accordingly as the due date approaches and add to a future iteration
