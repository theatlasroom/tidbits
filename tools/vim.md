# Vim
I'm not really a vim user, seems a bit too complex for the sake of complex. But sometimes I use it.

## General
`.vimrc` file is used to store configurations. it is located in your home directory
List of [special keys](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/intro.html#%3CNul%3E)

## Modes
Vim is a modal editor, to use the editor you need to be in the correct mode
* `CTRL+C`: command mode
* Normal mode default mode used to navigate around the file
* i - insert mode
* I - insert end of line
* v - visual mode, used to select blocks of text from a file, click `shift+v` to enter visual line mode
  - use hjkl to move around in visual mode
* a - append mode
* A - append end of line
* ctrl+ww - switch to another panel
* ctrl+w<hjkl> - move to split left, right ...etc
* ctrl+w| - to expand a split
* ctrl+w= - set the splits to an equal width

## Key commands
From command mode
* use the **hjkl** to move up down left and right
* use **w** to move to the next word and **b** to move to the previous
* `shift + v` - visual line mode

* **cw** - replace a word and change to insert mode
* **ew** - remove a word and stay in normal mode
* **cit** - delete content within a context - ie html inner text
* `ci+<character>`: context delete, ie `ci"` will delete the text in quote marks, `ci{` will delete text in braces
* **bd** - buffer delete -> close file
* `/<search>` - search for the term we specify, use n to move to the next occurence in the file
