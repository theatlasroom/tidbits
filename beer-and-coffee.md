# 🍺☕️

Two of my favourite beverages, so much variety and so many options. Currently im really enjoying the wave of sour, juicy and punchy beers, dark beers are constant and sour beers have some along nicely. I seem to enjoy most brews with [galaxy](https://www.hops.com.au/project/galaxy/) or [mosaic](https://www.cleverbrewing.com.au/mosaic-hops.html) hops, I'll never pass on a Nitro stout but can definitely appreciate a good wheat beer.

You can find me on [untappd](https://untappd.com/user/motorikpulse)

Australia is pretty blessed with a strong [coffee culture](https://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/food-and-drink/article/guide-melbournes-oddest-coffee-orders), I start most days with an aeropress or pour over coffee and while I generally stick to black coffee, hard pressed for a milk coffee i'll probably order a magic (double ristretto w/ 3/4 milk).
